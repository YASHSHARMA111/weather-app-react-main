# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Building a Weather App in React.js with OpenWeatherMap API

In this document, I'll guide you through the process of creating a simple Weather App in React.js that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather conditions, temperature, and humidity for a selected location.
Prerequisites

To get started, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
Node.js (version 12 or later)
npm (Node Package Manager)



Step 1: Set Up a New React Project
Open your terminal and create a new React project using create-react-app. If you don't have it installed, you can install it globally using npm:

npm install -g create-react-app

npx create-react-app weather-app-react-main

Navigate into the project directory:

cd weather-app-react-main

Step 2: Obtain an API Key from OpenWeatherMap
To access weather data from OpenWeatherMap API, you need an API key. Go to https://openweathermap.org/appid and sign up for a free account to get your API key.

Step 3: Install Necessary Dependencies
We will need to install some additional packages to work with APIs and handle user input. Install Axios, which is a popular HTTP client, and the package to work with environment variables:

npm install axios dotenv

Step 4: Implement the Weather App
Now we can start building our Weather App:

4.1 Update src/App.js
Write the code given by me in the App.js file & export default App in index.js file;


4.2 Update src/App.css
Create a new CSS file src/App.css and add some basic styling in it using the code provided by me in index.css file

Step 5: Test the Weather App
Now you're ready to test the Weather App! Start the development server using the following command:

npm start

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser, and you should see the Weather App interface. Enter the name of a location in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the current weather conditions, temperature, and humidity for the selected location.

Congratulations! We have successfully built a Weather App in React.js using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Next Steps and Improvements
This basic Weather App can be further improved and expanded. Here are some ideas for additional features:

Display weather icons based on the weather condition (you can use third-party icon libraries like "react-icons" or "react-weather-icons").
Show additional weather details such as wind speed, pressure, and weather description.
Add error handling for invalid or non-existent locations.
Implement geolocation to get weather data for the user's current location.
Improve the user interface with more sophisticated styling.
Remember to explore the official OpenWeatherMap API documentation to discover more data and endpoints that you can use to enhance your Weather App.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
